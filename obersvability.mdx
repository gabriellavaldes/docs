# Overview
With each operation, the output of your [Containers](core-concepts/architecture/containers/overview) is collected as Logs. This includes changes to your resources such as scaling, deploying, updating environment variables, creating backups, etc. 
    
> ðŸ§  Strictly speaking, `stdout` and `stderr` are captured. If you are using Docker locally, this is what you'd see when you run `docker logs ...`. Most importantly, this means **logs sent to files are not captured by Aptible logging**, so when you deploy your [Apps](core-concepts/apps/overview) on Aptible, you should ensure you are logging to `stdout` or `stderr`, and not to log files.

# Quick Access Logs
Aptible stores recent Logs for quick access. For long term retention of logs, you will need to set up aÂ [Log Drain](core-concepts/observability/logs/log-drains/overview).


## Using the CLI

App and Database logs can be accessed in real-time from the [CLI](reference/aptible-cli/overview) using theÂ [`aptible logs`](reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-logs) command. Upon executing this command, only the logs generated from that moment onward will be displayed.

Example:

```
aptible logs --app "$APP_HANDLE"
aptible logs --database "$DATABASE_HANDLE"
```

## Using the the Aptible Dashboard

Within the Aptible Dashboard, logs for recent operations can be acccessed by viewing recent [Activity](core-concepts/observability/activity).


# Log Integrations

## Log Drains
Log Drains let you route Logs to logging destinations for reviewing, searching, and alerting. Log Drains support capturing logs for Apps, Databases, SSH sessions, and Endpoints.
