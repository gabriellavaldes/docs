# Our story

Our journey began in **2013**, a time when HIPAA, with all its complexities, was still relatively new and challenging to decipher. As we approached September 2013, an impending deadline loomed large—the HIPAA Omnibus Rule was set to take effect in September 2023, mandating thousands of digital health companies to comply with HIPAA basically overnight. Recognizing this imminent need, Aptible embarked on a mission to simplify HIPAA for developers in healthcare, from solo developers at startups to large-scale development teams who lacked the time/resources to delve into the compliance space.

We brought a platform to the market that made HIPAA compliance achievable from day 1. Soon after, we expanded our scope to support HITRUST, SOC 2, ISO 27001, and more — establishing ourselves as the **go-to PaaS for digital health companies**.

As we continued to evolve our platform, we realized we had created something exceptional—a platform that streamlines security and compliance, offers reliable and high-performance infrastructure as the default, allows for easy resource scaling, and, to top it all off, features a best-in-class support team providing invaluable infrastructure expertise to our customers. It became evident that it could benefit a broader range of companies beyond the digital health sector. This realization led to a pivotal shift in our mission—to **alleviate infrastructure challenges for all dev teams**, not limited to healthcare.
