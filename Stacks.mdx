# Overview

Stacks are fundamental to the network-level isolation of your resources. Each stack is hosted in a specific region and is comprised of [environments](core-concepts/architecture/environments).

Aptible offers two types of stacks:  [shared stacks](core-concepts/architecture/stacks#shared-stacks) (non-isolated) and [dedicated stacks](core-concepts/architecture/stacks#dedicated-stacks) (isolated).

Resources in different stacks can only connect with each other with a [network integration.](core-concepts/integrations/network-integrations) For example: databases and internal endpoints deployed in a given stack are not accessible from apps deployed in other stacks.'

> 🧠 The underlying virtualized infrastructure (EC2 instances, private network, etc.), which provides network-level isolation of resources.

# Shared Stacks (Non-Isolated)

Stacks shared across many customers are called Shared Stacks. Use Shared Stacks for development, testing, and staging [Environments](core-concepts/architecture/environments).

Note: you can not host sensitive or regulated data with shared stacks.

# Dedicated Stacks (Isolated)

> 🏳️ Dedicated Stacks are only available on the [Growth, Scale and Enterprise plans.](https://www.aptible.com/pricing)

Dedicated stacks are built for production [environments](core-concepts/architecture/environments), are dedicated to a single customer, and provide four significant benefits:

* **Tenancy** - Dedicated stacks are isolated from other Aptible customers, and you can also use multiple Dedicated Stacks to architect the [isolation](https://community.aptible.com/t/what-kinds-of-isolation-can-aptible-provide/496) you require within your organization.
* **Availability** - Aptible's [Service Level Agreement](https://www.aptible.com/legal/service-level-agreement/) applies only to Environments hosted on a Dedicated stack.
* **Regulatory** - Aptible will sign a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) to cover information processing in Environments hosted on a Dedicated stack.
* **Connectivity** - [Integrations](core-concepts/integrations/network-integrations), such as VPN and VPC Peering connections, are available only to Dedicated stacks.
* **Security** - Dedicated stacks automatically come with a [suite of security features](https://www.aptible.com/secured-by-aptible), including encryption, DDoS protection, host hardening, [intrusion detection](core-concepts/security-compliance/hids), and [vulnerability scanning ](core-concepts/security-compliance/security-scans)— alleviating the need to worry about security best practices.

> 📘 A Stack's Region will affect the latency of customer connections based on proximity. For [VPC Peering](core-concepts/integrations/network-integrations), deploy the Aptible Stack in the same region as the AWS VPC for both latency and DNS concerns.
