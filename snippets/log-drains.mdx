title: InfluxDB Metric Drain
description: Learn about sending Aptible logs to an InfluxDB
---

Aptible can deliver your [Metrics](core-concepts/observability/metrics/overview) to any InfluxDB Database (hosted on Aptible or not). There are two types of InfluxDB Metric Drains on Aptible:

* Aptible-hosted: This method allows you to route metrics to an InfluxDB Database hosted on Aptible. This Database must live in the same Environment as the Metrics you are retrieving. Additionally, the [Aptible Metrics Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aptible/metrics/aptible/latest) uses this method to deploy prebuilt Grafana dashboards with alerts for monitoring RAM & CPU usage for your Apps & Databases - so you can instantly start monitoring your Aptible resources.
* Hosted anywhere: This method allows you to route Metrics to any InfluxDB. This might be useful if you are leveraging InfluxData's [hosted InfluxDB offering](https://www.influxdata.com/).

# InfluxDB Metrics Structure

Aptible InfluxDB Metric Drains publish metrics in a series named `metrics`.

The following values are published (approximately every 30 seconds):

* `running`: a boolean indicating whether the Container was running when this point was sampled.
* `milli_cpu_usage`: the Container's average CPU usage (in milli CPUs) over the reporting period.
* `milli_cpu_limit`: the maximum CPU accessible to the container.
* `memory_total_mb`: the Container's total memory usage.
* `memory_rss_mb`: the Container's RSS memory usage. This memory is typically not reclaimable. If this exceeds the `memory_limit_mb`, the container will be restarted.
* `memory_limit_mb`: the Container's [Memory Limit](core-concepts/scaling/memory-limits).
* `disk_read_kbps`: the Container's average disk read bandwidth over the reporting period.
* `disk_write_kbps`: the Container's average disk write bandwidth over the reporting period.
* `disk_read_iops`: the Container's average disk read IOPS over the reporting period.
* `disk_write_iops`: the Container's average disk write IOPS over the reporting period.
* `disk_usage_mb`: the Database's Disk usage (Database metrics only).
* `disk_limit_mb`: the Database's Disk size (Database metrics only).
* `pids_current`: the current number of tasks in the Container (see [Other Limits](core-concepts/security-compliance/ddos-pid-limits)).
* `pids_limit`: the maximum number of tasks for the Container (see [Other Limits](core-concepts/security-compliance/ddos-pid-limits)).

> ðŸ“˜ Review [Understanding Memory Utilization](core-concepts/scaling/memory-limits#understanding-memory-utilization) for more information on the meaning of the `memory_total_mb` and `memory_rss_mb` values.

> ðŸ“˜ Review [I/O Performance](core-concepts/scaling/database-scaling#i-o-performance) for more information on the meaning of the `disk_read_iops` and `disk_write_iops` values.

All points are enriched with the following tags:

* `environment`: Environment handle
* `app`: App handle (App metrics only)
* `database`: Database handle (Database metrics only)
* `service`: Service name
* `host_name`: [Container Hostname (Short Container ID)](core-concepts/architecture/containers/overview#container-hostname)
* `container`: full Container ID

# Getting Started
<AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Creating a Influx Metric Drain">
      A Datadog Log Drain can be created in three ways on Aptible:
    A Datadog Metric Drain can be provisioned in three ways on Aptible:
    * Within the Aptible Dashboard by:
      * Navigating to an Environment:
      * Selecting the **Metric Drains** tab
      * Selecting **Create Metric Drain**
    * Using the [`aptible metric_drain:create:datadog`](reference/aptible-cli/cli-commands/cli-metric-drain-create-datadog>) CLI command
    * Using the AptibleÂ [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aptible/aptible/latest/docs)
    </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accessing Metrics in DB">
  The best approach to accessing metrics from InfluxDB is to deploy [Grafana](https://grafana.com). Grafana is easy to deploy on Aptible.
   * **Recommended:** [Using Aptible Metrics Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aptible/metrics/aptible/latest). This provisions Metric Drains with pre-built Grafana dashboards and alerts for monitoring RAM & CPU usage for your Apps & Databases. This simplifies the setup of Metric Drains so you can start monitoring your Aptible resources immediately, all hosted within your Aptible account.
  * You can also follow this tutorial [Deploying Grafana on Aptible](https://www.aptible.com/docs/deploying-grafana-on-deploy), which includes suggested queries to set up within Grafana.
