# Overview

[Our story](getting-started/introduction#our-story) began with a strong focus on security and compliance, making us the leading Platform as a Service (PaaS) for security and compliance.

We provide developer-friendly infrastructure guardrails and solutions to help our customers navigate security audits and achieve compliance. This includes:

* **Security best practices, out-of-the-box**: When you provision a [dedicated stack](core-concepts/architecture/stacks), you automatically unlock a [suite of security features](/secured-by-aptible), including encryption, [DDoS protection](core-concepts/security-compliance/ddos-pid-limits), host hardening, [intrusion detection](core-concepts/security-compliance/hids), and [vulnerability scanning](core-concepts/security-compliance/security-scans) — alleviating the need to worry about security best practices.
* **Security and Compliance Dashboard**: The [Security & Compliance Dashboard](core-concepts/security-compliance/security-compliance-dashboard/overview) provides a unified view of the implemented security controls —  track progress, achieve compliance, and easily generate summarized reports.
* **Access control**: Secure access to your resources is ensured with [granular user permission](core-concepts/security-compliance/access-permissions) controls, [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](core-concepts/security-compliance/authentication/password-authentication#2-factor-authentication-2fa), and [Single Sign-On (SSO)](core-concepts/security-compliance/authentication/sso) support.
* **Compliance made easy**: We provide HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), HITRUST Inheritance, and streamlined SOC 2 compliance solutions — CISO-approved.
