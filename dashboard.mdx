Overview
--------

The [Aptible Dashboard](https://app.aptible.com/login) allows you to create, view, and manage your Aptible account, including resources, deployments, members, settings, and more.

Getting Started
---------------

When you first sign up for Aptible, you will first be guided through your first deployment using one of our [starter templates](getting-started/deploy-starter-template/overview) or your own [custom code](getting-started/deploy-custom-code). Once you‚Äôve done so, you will be routed to your account within Aptible Dashboard.
