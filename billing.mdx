# Overview

To review or modify your billing information, navigate to your account settings within the Aptible Dashboard and select the appropriate option from the Billing section of the navigation.

# Navigating Billing

> ⚠️ Most billing actions are restricted to _Account Owners_. Billing contacts must request that an _Account Owner_ make necessary changes.

The following information and settings are available under each section:

*   Plans: View and manage your plan.
*   Contracts: View a list of your billing contracts, if any.
*   Invoices & Projections: View historical invoices and your projected future invoices based on current usage patterns.
*   Payment Methods: Add or update a payment method.
*   Credits: View credits applied to your account.    
*   Contacts: Manage billing contacts who receive a copy of your invoices by email.
*   Billing Address: Set your billing address.
    

> ❗️ Aptible uses billing address information to determine your sales tax withholding per your local (state, county, city) tax rates.
